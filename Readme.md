# Rocketseat's FinApi #01 

Part of Rocketseat's introductory course to NodeJs. The goal is to develop a simple API and learn further about HTTP requests.

During this introductory part of the course I learned the basics about HTTP requests, Express.js usage with Node and also the concept of middlewares. ðŸš€

This repo is using Nodemon for a better development experience. You can run it after installing with:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or

```bash
yarn dev
```

### What have I learned?

I wrote a post in my blog to help my learning process during this course. This challenge was short, but it's always good to revisit de basics on HTTP requests and the usage of Express.
